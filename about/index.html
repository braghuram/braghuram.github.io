Violin Maestro B Raghuram was born to Vidwan Harmonium S. Bheema Rao and Smt Rajamma in 1960, Bangalore. Harmonium and violin maestro 'Shruthi-Laya Visharada' S. Bheema Rao is a disciple of Mysore Palace Asthana Vidwan Bidaram Krishnappa. He accompanied on violin and harmonium,  the great stalwarts of those days like Bidaram Krishnappa, H Muthaiah Bhagavatar etc. He has few great compositions to his name which are being rendered regularly even today. One such composition a varnam in Bahudari raga, redered by Sri B Raghuram can be heard from the below link

<br>
<br>
Sri B Raghuram started violin at the age of 5 under the guidance of his father. He was very quick in grasping the intricacies of the music and mastering the techniques of playing on violin and harmonium. 

<br>
<br>
He gave his first concert at the age of 10.

<br>
<br>
Today, Sri B Raghuram regularly accompanies top artistes both on violin and Harmonium. It is not uncommon for him sometimes to carry both violin and harmonium to a concert and play what ever the main artiste wants him to accompany  with. 
His depth of knowledge and the ability to bring out the essence of a raga is greatly appreciated by scholars and listeners alike. The level of command he has on the laya aspect of music is very rare to find. No wonder he is a very sought out artiste. 

<br>
<br>

He is highly knowledgeable yet very humble person. Students/learners just flock over to him.  He is so flexible in accommodating students from all age groups (he has students with ages between 5 to 70yrs) irrespective of their financial/social position. All that takes one to learn music from him is the interest and dedication towards music. He has several of his students playing violin professionally today.
B Raghuram is an accomplished composer as well. His style resembles  that  of an authentic  Mysore-Baani. One of his famous varnams, composed in a very rare-raga  Jyothiswaroopini can be heard from the link below:
